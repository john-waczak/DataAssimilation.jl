Further, the explosion of big data across scientific fields provieds a plethora observational data that our models are typically unequipped to incorporate. The field of Data Assimilation addresses this problem by providing a family of techniques engineered to conbine model output together with observational data whilst enabling a complete accounting the sources of uncertainty. For chaotic systems in particular, data assimilation enables integration on long time scales that would be impossible via models alone.
